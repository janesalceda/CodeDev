# Ansible NGINX Server Setup

This Ansible playbook installs and configures NGINX on a Linux server. It sets up a virtual host configuration, ensures NGINX is enabled to start at boot, and adds a cron job to ensure it is always running.

## Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on the control machine
- A target Linux server with SSH access and sudo privileges

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the playbook directory.

```sh
git clone codev_assessment
cd CodeDev
